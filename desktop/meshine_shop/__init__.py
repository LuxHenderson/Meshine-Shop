Meshine Shop — Photogrammetry-to-Game-Asset Pipeline

This is the top-level package for the Meshine Shop desktop application.
The app converts photogrammetry data (photo sets or LiDAR scans) into
game-ready 3D assets (.FBX/.glTF) with optimized meshes, UV maps,
and PBR textures.

The version string below is the single source of truth for the app's
